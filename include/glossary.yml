alpha: |
  The threshold chosen in Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing to distinguish test results that lead to the decision to reject the null hypothesis, or not, based on the desired upper bound of the Type 1 error rate. An alpha level of 5% it most commonly used, but other alpha levels can be used as long as they are determined and preregistered by the researcher before the data is analyzed.
p-value: |
  The probability of the observed data, or more extreme data, if the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the higher the test statistic, and less likely it is to observe the data if the null hypothesis is true.
mixed model: |
  A mixed model, mixed-effects model or mixed error-component model is a statistical model containing both fixed effects and random effects. These models are useful in a wide variety of disciplines in the physical, biological and social sciences.
